inheritance - it means that when you create a subclass for a class things from the class will inheritance to the subclass, such
  as: the fields and method from the super class can still be used in the subclass.


polymorphism - when you create subclass for a class it can more than one, and it make the class more diversity also method can
  be overloaded within super class and subclass. Such as the intro method that we have made during the lesson, it can overload
  in Person class and Student class.
